# WalletConnect integration guide

This document outlines the integration between Qubic Wallet and dApps via WalletConnect.

## What is WalletConnect

WalletConnect is an open source technology that makes it easy to connect any supported mobile or hardware wallets to dApp using QR codes and secure links, allowing users to sign transactions needed for these applications from their wallets.

## Terminology

| Term    | Explanation                                                                                        |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dApp    | A (web3) application which needs access to the Qubic Wallet                                        |
| session | A connection between a dAPP and the Qubic Wallet                                                   |
| method  | Functionality that is exposed by the Qubic Wallet and can be invoked by the dAPP                   |
| event   | Information that can be pushed from the Qubic Wallet to a dAPP without the later making any action |

## Session establishment

A dAPP initializes a connection to the WC servers and generates a connection URL. This URL contains info about the dAPP and the required _methods_ and _events_ that are going to be used in the connection. This URL is passed to the wallet (via copy - past / QR code scanning ).The wallet prompts its user to accept or reject the connection.
If rejected, the client receives
`{code: 5000, message: 'User rejected.'}`
If accepted, the client receives a
`session connected` event. This event contains various info, most importantly the _expiration time_(when the session dies) and _topic_(which is an ID)
Once accepted, the connection is established as a session. The session can be active for a few hours to a few days.
